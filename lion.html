    The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
    broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
    dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
    groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
    lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although
    some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively
    seek out and prey on humans.

    The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
    persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged
    throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in
    sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since
    1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
    untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat
    loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

    One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
    sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since
    the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the
    world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have
    occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.

    Etymology
    The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem (nominative: leō), which in turn was a
    borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων léōn. The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related.[4] The generic name
    Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[5]

    Taxonomy

    The upper cladogram is based on the 2006 study,[6][7] the lower one on the 2010[8] and 2011[9] studies.
    Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema
    Naturae.[3] The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[10] Between the mid-18th and mid-20th
    centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in
    2005.[1] They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.[11]
