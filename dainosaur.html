    Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic
    period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of
    dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
    Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous
    periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during
    the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene
    extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct
    non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.

    Dinosaurs are varied from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 11,000 living species,
    are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900
    distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every
    continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before
    birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and
    cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals
    with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others
    carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying, and that nest-building was a trait shared by many
    dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.
