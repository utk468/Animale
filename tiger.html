    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It
    has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail, and distinctive black, mostly vertical
    stripes on orange fur. It was first scientifically described in 1758 and is traditionally classified into eight
    recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, namely mainland Asian tigers and island tigers of the
    Sunda Islands
